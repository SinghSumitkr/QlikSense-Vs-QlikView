Limitations of Qlik Sense Compared to QlikView

Qlik Sense and QlikView are both powerful business intelligence (BI) tools developed by Qlik, but they have some differences in their capabilities. While Qlik Sense offers modern self-service analytics and visualizations, QlikView is known for its guided analytics approach. Here is a detailed document highlighting the limitations of Qlik Sense compared to QlikView as of my last update in September 2021.

1. Guided Analytics vs. Self-Service:

QlikView: QlikView follows a guided analytics approach, where developers create guided and structured analytics applications for end-users. It is designed for developers and power users to build complex data models and guided dashboards, making it suitable for applications with a defined structure and analysis path.

Qlik Sense: Qlik Sense focuses on self-service data exploration and visualization. While it empowers business users to create their own visualizations and dashboards, it might require a higher level of data literacy and analytical skills from end-users. Qlik Sense is more flexible for ad-hoc data discovery, but might not be as suitable for applications with a strict guided analytics flow.

2. Scripting and Data Modeling:

QlikView: QlikView provides a powerful scripting language and data modeling capabilities. Developers can perform complex data transformations during the load process using QlikView's robust scripting functionalities.

Qlik Sense: While Qlik Sense also supports data transformations through its scripting capabilities, it might not offer the same level of depth and flexibility as QlikView. Qlik Sense places more emphasis on data visualization and exploration, and its scripting features may not be as extensive as those in QlikView.

3. Customization and Extensions:

QlikView: QlikView allows for extensive customization and supports a wide range of extensions. Developers can create custom visualizations, charts, and components tailored to their specific requirements.

Qlik Sense: Qlik Sense has a growing library of extensions, but it might still have limitations when compared to QlikView in terms of customization. While users can find various extensions, highly specialized or unique customization needs might be more challenging to achieve.

4. Sheet-Level Security:

QlikView: QlikView provides sheet-level security, allowing developers to control access to specific sheets within an application. Different users or user groups can be granted access to certain sheets based on their roles and permissions.

Qlik Sense: As of my last update, Qlik Sense does not offer built-in sheet-level security. While it provides robust data security features, the lack of sheet-level security might be a limitation for organizations that require finer control over access to individual sheets within an application.

5. Legacy Application Migration:

QlikView: Organizations with mature and complex analytics applications developed in QlikView might face challenges when migrating to Qlik Sense. The transition process could require significant effort and resources, especially if the applications heavily rely on QlikView-specific features and functionalities.

Qlik Sense: While Qlik provides tools and guidance for migration from QlikView to Qlik Sense, some features might not have direct equivalents, leading to potential changes in application design and functionality.

6. Versioning and Deployment Control:

QlikView: QlikView offers more granular control over versioning and deployment of applications. Developers can manage different versions of an application and control the deployment of specific updates.

Qlik Sense: As of my last update, Qlik Sense's versioning and deployment control might be more limited compared to QlikView. Managing different versions of an application and controlling updates might not be as straightforward.

7. User Interface Customization:

QlikView: QlikView provides greater flexibility in customizing the user interface, allowing developers to achieve highly tailored UI designs and branding.

Qlik Sense: While Qlik Sense offers a modern and user-friendly interface, the level of UI customization might be more limited compared to QlikView, especially for organizations with specific branding requirements.

Conclusion:

Qlik Sense and QlikView are both powerful BI tools, each with its unique strengths and limitations. While Qlik Sense focuses on self-service analytics and modern data exploration, QlikView excels in guided analytics development and advanced data modeling. Organizations should carefully consider their specific requirements, user skill levels, and application needs when choosing between the two platforms. Additionally, it's essential to review the latest updates and features in both Qlik Sense and QlikView, as Qlik continuously enhances and improves its products to meet evolving customer needs.


Limitations of Qlik Sense compared to QlikView
Qlik Sense is a powerful and versatile business intelligence (BI) tool that offers a wide range of features and capabilities. However, there are some limitations that should be considered when evaluating Qlik Sense for your organization.

1. Less flexibility and customization

Qlik Sense is designed for self-service BI, which means that it is primarily intended for end users to create and share their own analytics. This can be a major advantage, as it allows users to quickly and easily explore data and find insights that they might not have been able to see with a more traditional BI tool. However, it also means that Qlik Sense is less flexible and customizable than QlikView. With QlikView, developers have more control over the data model, the layout, and the visualizations. This can be important for organizations that need to create custom reports or dashboards that meet specific requirements.

2. Less powerful data integration capabilities

Qlik Sense is a cloud-based BI tool, which means that it is optimized for data that is stored in the cloud. This can be an advantage for organizations that are looking to move their data to the cloud. However, it can also be a limitation, as Qlik Sense does not have as powerful data integration capabilities as QlikView. With QlikView, users can connect to a wider range of data sources, including on-premises databases, enterprise data warehouses, and cloud-based data lakes.

3. Less scalability

Qlik Sense is designed for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). It can be scaled up to handle larger datasets, but it is not as scalable as QlikView. QlikView is designed for large enterprises with complex data requirements. It can handle massive datasets and multiple users simultaneously.

4. Less mature ecosystem

Qlik Sense is a newer BI tool than QlikView, and as a result, it has a less mature ecosystem. There are fewer third-party add-ons and integrations available for Qlik Sense than for QlikView. This can make it more difficult for organizations to find the solutions they need to meet their specific requirements.

5. Higher cost

Qlik Sense is a more expensive BI tool than QlikView. The monthly subscription price for Qlik Sense is higher than the annual licensing fee for QlikView. This can be a major consideration for organizations with limited budgets.

Overall, Qlik Sense is a powerful and versatile BI tool that offers a wide range of features and capabilities. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of Qlik Sense before making a decision about whether it is the right BI tool for your organization.

Recommendation

If you are looking for a BI tool that is flexible, customizable, and scalable, then QlikView is a better choice than Qlik Sense. QlikView offers more powerful data integration capabilities and a wider range of third-party add-ons and integrations. It is also more affordable than Qlik Sense.

However, if you are looking for a cloud-based BI tool that is easy to use and requires less IT support, then Qlik Sense is a good option. Qlik Sense is designed for self-service BI, so end users can quickly and easily create and share their own analytics. It is also more affordable than QlikView for SMBs.
